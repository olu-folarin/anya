                <h3 class="text-secondary">Dear Hiring Manager,</h3>
                <p>
                    I wanted to take this opportunity to express my interest in the Business Operations position that you currently have open, and to detail my qualifications and credentials. I am interested ina position that woukld let me do my best work empowering others, and I am excited that this opportunity would allow me to do that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the past four years, I have run operations at Homeaglow, a cleaning platform startup based in SF. I was responsible for recruiting and developing a customer service team based overseas, as well as the day-to-day operations of the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal at Homeaglow was to create a diverse team and empower them with data-driven operational policiesand infrastructure. This taught me the importance how to drive impact through metrics, how to create constructive and effective feedback, and how to manage people for maximum long-term value to the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the past 5+ years, I have handled diverse teams, led and coached both employees and managers.I love to implement creative solutions to the challenges that come withoperations positions, and I have, through my startup experience, learned to move quickly and decisively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for the consideration.
                </p>
